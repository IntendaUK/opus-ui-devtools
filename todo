* Pretty render genStyles
* See current flow value
* Sort properties by name
* Group properties by type (custom vs css, etc.)
* Base property data type on propSpec, not on value
* Tree stays the same if you open devtools for a different website while you already have another one open
* Script (and firescript) trigger/actions viewer
* Properties with options in their spec should have dropdowns for their values
* Weird parent issue on opus ui website where the cpn doesn't exist (for the code sections somewhere)
* Add diagnostics to scripts from devtools
* See diagnostic results in devtools
* Click to copy component path
* Clicking on flows source/target with a scoped id doesn't work
* Hovering on elements that don't exist in the dom should not give an error (perhaps show the parent instead...would help for dataloaders)
* Filter DOM on component types (modify tree)
